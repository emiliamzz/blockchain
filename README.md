# blockchain
An assignment for my Data Structures and Algorithms class.
The gist of it was that I had to program a blockchain that
could read an existing blockchain from a .txt file, verify
that it was valid, add a new user-inputted transaction to
the blockchain (and verify that it was valid), find the
hash for the transaction, and output the results in a
.txt file.
